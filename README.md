# Hierarchical Level-Wise News Article Clustering via Multilingual Matryoshka Embeddings


This project focuses on clustering news articles using a hierarchical approach with multilingual Matryoshka embeddings. The aim is to group articles in a way that captures both fine-grained and coarse-grained similarities across different languages, enabling more accurate and meaningful clustering in multilingual contexts.
